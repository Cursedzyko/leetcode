An Array is a collection of items.
___________________________________________________
|                                                 |
| ARRAY ALWAYS HAS A FIXED SIZE AND IT IS STATIC  | (vector dynamic arrays)

The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. 
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. 
Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.


Capacity of the array is max element that array can hold(array wwas created)
Array length is number of element that is already exists



Insert a new DVD into the collection at a specific location.
Delete a DVD from the existing collection if it doesn't make sense to keep it in the inventory anymore.
Search for a particular DVD in the collection.
This is one of the most commonly executed operation on our collection, because our inventory management
software would be used hundreds of times a day to look for a particular DVD asked for by the user.



Insert

Inserting a new element at the end of the Array. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ O(1) 

arr[arr.size()] = num


Inserting a new element at the beginning of the Array.++++++++++++++++++++++ O(n) 

for(int i = 0; i < arr.szie(); i++)
{
	arr[i + 1] = arr[i];
}
arr[0] = num;

Inserting a new element at any given index inside the Array.++++++++++++++++ O(n)

int i = arr.size() - 2;
while (i >=0 && arr[i] < num)
{
	arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
	i--;
}
arr[i + 1] = num;
