The circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. 
In a circular linked list, the first node and the last node are connected to each other which forms a circle. 
There is no NULL at the end.

The CURSOR node allows us to have a place to start from if we ever need to traverse a
circularly linked list.

cursor is the last element of the linked list, next is the beggining og the list.
