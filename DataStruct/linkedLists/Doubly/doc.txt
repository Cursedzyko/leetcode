            Doubly linked list is preferred when we donâ€™t have memory 
     limitation and searching is required(we need to perform search operation on the linked list).


A Doubly Linked List has a previous link field along with a data field and a next link field.


In a Doubly Linked List, the traversal(access) can be done using the next node link as well as the previous node link.

Accessing elements in a Doubly Linked List is more efficient when compared 
to a Singly Linked List as both forward and backward traversal is possible.

The time complexity of inserting or deleting a node at a given position 
(if the pointer to that position is given) in a doubly linked list is O(1).
