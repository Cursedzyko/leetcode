Two pointer technique used to search smth in array, string, 
linked list and will take O(n) time if input is sorted, 
if it is not we need to sort input than use this technique

Variants of two pointers:
Opposite direction- one pointer starts from beginning and second from end, they move towards each other.
Equi  direction - both pointers start from beginning, one slow, second fast.
